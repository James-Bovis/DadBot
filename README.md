## Getting started

DadBot is now built with help from the great [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool. To get
started with your own local version of DadBot simply run: `yarn start` in your
terminal.

For running tests `yarn test` is the command you'll need to run tests on the
entire DadBot App.

To build DadBot ready for production, simply run `yarn build` and a production
ready `build` bolder will be made ready to be deployed.
